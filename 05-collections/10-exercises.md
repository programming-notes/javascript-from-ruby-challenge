Each link points to a [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) which includes specs written in [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

Follow the instructions in the JavaScript pane and write code to make the specs pass.

1. [average.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/kLjXM/) - Write four instance methods for `Array`: total, mean, median, and mode.
2. [pad.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/gNVbA/) - Write `Array.pad()` to fill out an array with a specified value.

NOTE: These exercises utilize features in JavaScript that have not yet been covered in this section.  If you feel ill-equipped to solve them, read ahead through the appropriate lesson(s) first and then come back to the exercise.
