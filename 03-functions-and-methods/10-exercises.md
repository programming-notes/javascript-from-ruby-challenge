Each link points to a [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) which includes specs written in [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

Follow the instructions in the JavaScript pane and write code to make the specs pass.

1. [rectangle.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/XUnbN/) - Write four functions that take a rectangle object and return information about it.
2. [validTriangle.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/hfp83/) - Write a function `validTriangle()` which determines whether three sides make a valid triangle.

NOTE: These exercises utilize features in JavaScript that have not yet been covered in this section.  If you feel ill-equipped to solve them, read ahead through the appropriate lesson(s) first and then come back to the exercise.
