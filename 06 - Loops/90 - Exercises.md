Each link points to a [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) which includes specs written in [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).

Follow the instructions in the JavaScript pane and write code to make the specs pass.

1. [countBetween.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/bBZ4w/) - Write a function to return the number of elements within a given range.
2. [factorial.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/LTEwX/) - Calculate the factorial of a number.
3. [longestString.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/2YbTD/) - Find the longest string in an array.
4. [timesTable.js](http://jsfiddle.net/openspectrum/4KKDe/) - Print out a times table for a given positive integer.

NOTE: These exercises utilize features in JavaScript that have not yet been covered in this section.  If you feel ill-equipped to solve them, read ahead through the appropriate lesson(s) first and then come back to the exercise.
